Math is hard, let's go shopping
-------------------------------

In first grade I learned that 5 > 3 and 2 < 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -> 2 -> 3. 9 <- 8 <- 7.

Triangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2

We all like making lists
------------------------

The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:

* Red Apples
* Purple Grapes
* Green Kiwifruits

Let's get crazy:

1.  This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor
    sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit
    mi posuere lectus.

    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
    vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum
    sit amet velit.

2.  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

What about some code **in** a list? That's insane, right?

1. In Ruby you can map like this:

        ['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }

2. In Rails, you can do a shortcut:

        ['a', 'b'].map(&:uppercase)

Some people seem to like definition lists

<dl>
  <dt>Lower cost</dt>
  <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
  <dt>Easier to use</dt>
  <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
</dl>

I am a robot
------------

Maybe you want to print `robot` to the console 1000 times. Why not?

    def robot_invasion
      puts("robot " * 1000)
    end

You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.

How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?

    <div class="footer">
        &copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
    </div>

Set in stone
------------

Preformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:

<pre>
             ,-. 
    ,     ,-.   ,-. 
   / \   (   )-(   ) 
   \ |  ,.>-(   )-< 
    \|,' (   )-(   ) 
     Y ___`-'   `-' 
     |/__/   `-' 
     | 
     | 
     |    -hrr- 
  ___|_____________ 
</pre>

Playing the blame game
----------------------

If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:

> I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.

Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:

> I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I
> could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in
> the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to
> come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...
>
> I don't want to sound like
> I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you
> just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet
> as I should be in coming up with one.

# FunSize: Cocoa, but smaller.

FunSize is an Objective-C framework comprised entirely of categories and intended to make Cocoa code shorter, while maintaining expressiveness. Here are a few approaches taken:

* Use blocks, a lot. They're pretty cool.
* Make `NSNumber` and `NSValue` as invisible as possible. They are ugly and
  provide no additional information. Instead, provide messages for low-level
  data types (`int`, `NSRect`, `CATransform3D`, etc).
* Replace absurdly long messages. `CAMediaTimingFunction`'s
  `+functionWithName:` takes one of five constants, each of which is prefixed
  with `kCAMediaTimingFunction`. `[CAMediaTimingFunction easeOut]` is much more
  succinct.
* Use reasonable defaults. Why is there no simple `-CGImage` or `-drawInRect:`
  for `NSImage`? There is now. Additionally, 99% of `NSNotificationCenter`
  usage is on the `-defaultCenter`. So, FunSize has class-level versions of all
  `NSNotificationCenter` (and `NSUserDefaults`) instance messages.

## Current Status

FunSize was written while writing a Mac OS X application. Most of it presumably works on iOS, but some `#ifdef`s are probably needed for classes that don't exist (`NSView`). I used garbage collection in that application, and while I attempted to insert `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` where applicable,
I haven't tested it extensively without GC (for this reason, I will not be using GC in my next application).

**New Note**: It *seems* to work fine with reference counting now, as I've been running Leaks on my current project, which uses manual reference counting and makes extensive use of FunSize. If there are any remaining leaks, they would show up pretty clearly in Leaks anyways (which I assume everyone runs...right?)

## Usage

The Xcode project target is a framework. Honestly, I haven't really used it, I simply added the source files to my project. Either way should work, however. I don't think Apple will be shipping FunSize any time soon, so you'll have to distribute it with each application anyways.

`FunSize.h` imports all of the other headers. Personally, I added it to my prefix header so that FunSize feels like part of Cocoa. Actually, while I was writing this, I was surprised to learn that `-[NSImage CGImage]` *isn't* part of Cocoa.

## Style

If you would like to contribute to FunSize, please follow this style.

### What FunSize does and does not do

* FunSize adds category methods.
* FunSize does not do anything else.

Note that this rule only applies to "public" things. "Helper" classes are
perfectly acceptable (see `NSTimer+FunSize.m`), but they cannot be included in
any header files that are included with a compiled copy of FunSize. The same
applies to structs, typedefs, and anything else that isn't a category method.

### Documentation

Everything should be documented in
[appledoc](http://www.gentlebytes.com/home/appledocapp/) style. There's no need
to go overkill documenting parameters or returns that are really obvious to
anyone smart enough to be the type of software developer that seeks out
Objective-C category frameworks. But at least say something, since the appledoc
pages look really ugly otherwise. Also, although appledoc warns about it, the
classes that categories are being added to don't need to be documented.

Separate sections in header files like this:

    #pragma mark -
    #pragma mark Recursive Subview Operations
    /** @name Recursive Subview Operations */
    
The final line is for appledoc, and should be left off in the implementation
file.

Reasonably current documentation is available
[here](http://funsize.natestedman.com/documentation).

### Naming Things

Boring and easy things first: filenames are `Class+FunSize.h` and
`Class+FunSize.m`. Category declarations are `Class (FunSize)`.

For naming actual messages, try to stay within Apple style (within reason). An
example is the usage of `CATransform3D`. `CA*` classes refer to it as a
"transform", so I added `-setFromTransform` to `CABasicAnimation`. `NSValue`,
however, has `-CATransform3DValue`. Therefore, when I added key/value messages
to `NSObject` to support `CATransform3D`, I used the style
`-CATransform3DForKey:`.

### Braces and Spaces

In general, just look at the current style and copy it. But basically, use
four spaces for indentation, since Xcode is bad at handling tabs. Use Allman
style for everything except blocks, which use K&R (why? I think it's most
readable like that).Declare pointers like this: `NSImage*`. Put spaces in math
(`2 + 2`, not `2+2`), because it's good if math is actually readable.



Blocks in C and Objective-C are downright magical.  They make coding easier and potentially quicker, not to mention faster on the front end with multithreading and Grand Central Dispatch.  BlocksKit hopes to facilitate this kind of programming by removing some of the annoying - and, in some cases, impeding - limits on coding with blocks.

BlocksKit is a framework and static library for iOS 4.0+ and Mac OS X 10.6+.

Installation
============

BlocksKit can be added to a project using [CocoaPods](https://github.com/alloy/cocoapods).

### Framework

* Download a release of BlocksKit.
* Move BlocksKit.framework to your project's folder.  Drag it from there into your project.
* Add BlocksKit.framework to "Link Binary With Libraries" in your app's target. Make sure your app is linked with CoreGraphics, Foundation, MessageUI, and UIKit.
* In the build settings of your target or project, change "Other Linker Flags" (`OTHER_LDFLAGS`) to `-ObjC -all_load`.
* Insert `#import <BlocksKit/BlocksKit.h>` in your project's prefix header.
* Make amazing software.

### Library

* Download a release of BlocksKit.
* Move libBlocksKit.a and Headers to your project's folder, preferably a subfolder like "Vendor".
* In "Build Phases", Drag libBlocksKit.a into your target's "Link Binary With Libraries" build phase. 
* In the build settings of your target or project, change "Other Linker Flags" to `-ObjC -all_load`. Make sure your app is linked with CoreGraphics, Foundation, MessageUI, and UIKit.
* Change (or add) to "Header Search Paths" the relative path to BlocksKit's headers, like `$(SRCROOT)/Vendor/Headers`.
* Insert `#import <BlocksKit/BlocksKit.h>`` in your project's prefix header.

Documentation
=============

An Xcode 4 compatible documentation set is available [using this Atom link](http://zwaldowski.github.com/BlocksKit/com.dizzytechnology.BlocksKit.atom). You may also view the documentation [online](http://zwaldowski.github.com/BlocksKit/Documentation).

#Functional.m

Functional.m is an extension for objective-c, that can be used to do functional programming.

Here's the documentation for the individual functions:

The numberArray NSArray contains a collection of NSNumbers, The dict NSDictionary contains the same collection - the keys are the names of the numbers

```objc
    NSArray *numberArray = [NSArray arrayFrom:1 To:5];
    NSArray *numberNamesArray = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"one", @"two", @"three", @"four", @"five", nil];
    NSDictionary *numberDict = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjects:numberArray forKeys:numberNamesArray];
```

##each

The given iterator runs for each object in the collection.

- `- (void) each:(VoidIteratorArrayBlock) block;`
- `- (void) each:(VoidIteratorDictBlock) block;`

Example:

```objc
    [numberArray each:^(id obj) {
        NSLog(@"Current Object : %@", obj);
    }];
    
    [numberDict each:^(id key, id value) {
        NSLog(@"%@ => %@", key, value);
    }];
```

##map

Each object in the collection can be transformed in the iterator.

- `- (NSArray *) map:(MapArrayBlock) block;`
- `- (NSDictionary *) map:(MapDictBlock) block;`

Example:

```objc
    NSArray *doubleArray = [numberArray map:^NSNumber*(NSNumber *obj) {
        return [NSNumber numberWithInt:([obj intValue]*2)];
    }];
    NSDictionary *doubleDict = [numberDict map:^NSNumber*(id key, NSNumber *obj) {
        return [NSNumber numberWithInt:([obj intValue]*2)];
    }];
    
    NSLog(@"Double : Array %@ - Dict %@", doubleArray, doubleDict);
```

##reduce

Reduces all objects in the collection to a single value (something like computing the average etc.)

- `- (id) reduce:(ReduceArrayBlock) block withInitialMemo:(id) memo;`
- `- (id) reduce:(ReduceDictBlock) block withInitialMemo:(id) memo;`

Example - adds all NSNumbers in the array or dictionary.

```objc 
    NSNumber *memo = [NSNumber numberWithInt:0];
    
    NSNumber *sumArray = [numberArray reduce:^NSNumber*(NSNumber *memo, NSNumber *cur) {
        return [NSNumber numberWithInt:([memo intValue] + [cur intValue])];
    } withInitialMemo:memo];
    
    NSNumber *sumDict = [numberDict reduce:^NSNumber*(NSNumber *memo, id key, NSNumber *cur) {
        return [NSNumber numberWithInt:([memo intValue] + [cur intValue])];
    } withInitialMemo:memo];
    
    NSLog(@"Sum : Array %@ - Dict %@", sumArray, sumDict);
```

##filter and reject

`Filter` gives you only those objects, for that the iterator returns true. `Reject` removes all objects for that the iterator returns true.

- `- (NSArray *) filter:(BoolArrayBlock) block;`
- `- (NSArray *) reject:(BoolArrayBlock) block;`

- `- (NSDictionary*) filter:(BoolDictionaryBlock) block;`
- `- (NSDictionary*) reject:(BoolDictionaryBlock) block;`

This example gives you all even (filter) or odd (reject) numbers in the array / dict:

```objc
        BoolArrayBlock isEvenArrayBlock = ^BOOL(NSNumber *obj) {
            return (([obj intValue] % 2) == 0);
        };
        BoolDictionaryBlock isEvenDictBlock = ^BOOL(id key, NSNumber *obj) {
            return (([obj intValue] % 2) == 0);
        };
    
        NSArray *evenArr    = [numberArray filter:isEvenArrayBlock];
        NSDictionary *evenDict   = [numberDict filter:isEvenDictBlock];
        NSLog(@"The following elements are even : Array %@ - Dict %@", evenArr, evenDict);
    
    #pragma mark - reject
        NSArray *oddArr = [numberArray reject:isEvenArrayBlock];
        NSDictionary *oddDict = [numberDict reject:isEvenDictBlock];
        NSLog(@"The following elements are odd : Array %@ - Dict %@", oddArr, oddDict);   
```

##isValidForAll and isValidForAny

`isValidForAll` returns YES if the iterator returns YES for all elements in the collection. `isValidForAny` returns YES if the iterator returns YES for at least one object in the collection.

- `- (BOOL) isValidForAll:(BoolArrayBlock) block;`
- `- (BOOL) isValidForAny:(BoolArrayBlock) block;`

- `- (BOOL) isValidForAll:(BoolDictionaryBlock) block;`
- `- (BOOL) isValidForAny:(BoolDictionaryBlock) block;`

This example checks if all or any elements in the collection are even numbers

```objc
    BoolArrayBlock isEvenArrayBlock = ^BOOL(NSNumber *obj) {
        return (([obj intValue] % 2) == 0);
    };
    BoolDictionaryBlock isEvenDictBlock = ^BOOL(id key, NSNumber *obj) {
        return (([obj intValue] % 2) == 0);
    };

    NSLog(@"Only even numbers : Array %d - Dict %d", [numberArray isValidForAll:isEvenArrayBlock], [numberDict isValidForAll:isEvenDictBlock]);
    # pragma mark - isValidForAny
    NSLog(@"Any even numbers : Array %d - Dict %d", [numberArray isValidForAny:isEvenArrayBlock], [numberDict isValidForAny:isEvenDictBlock]);
```

##countValidEntries

Counts the number of entries in a set, for which the given block returns true:

- `- (NSNumber *) countValidEntries:(BoolArrayBlock) block;`
- `- (NSNumber *) countValidEntries:(BoolDictionaryBlock) block;`

```objc
    BoolArrayBlock isEvenArrayBlock = ^BOOL(NSNumber *obj) {
        return (([obj intValue] % 2) == 0);
    };
    BoolDictionaryBlock isEvenDictBlock = ^BOOL(id key, NSNumber *obj) {
        return (([obj intValue] % 2) == 0);
    };

    NSNumber *ctEvenArr     = [numberArray countValidEntries:isEvenArrayBlock];
    NSNumber *ctEvenDict    = [numberDict countValidEntries:isEvenDictBlock];
    NSLog(@"The number of even elements are : Array %@ - Dict %@", ctEvenArr, ctEvenDict);
```

##dropWhile

Drops every entry before the first item the block returns true for.

- `- (NSArray *) dropWhile:(BoolArrayBlock) block;`

```objc
	NSArray *droppedUntilThree = [numberArray dropWhile:^BOOL(NSNumber *nr) {
	    return ([nr integerValue] < 3);
	}];
	NSLog(@"Array from 3 : %@", droppedUntilThree);
```

##max and min

Return the maximum and the minimum values in a collection. You will have to write a comperator, which compares two elements.

- `- (id) max:(CompareArrayBlock) block;`
- `- (id) min:(CompareArrayBlock) block;`

- `- (id) max:(CompareDictBlock) block;`
- `- (id) min:(CompareDictBlock) block;`

Here's an example that gets the minimum and the maximum value from the array and dict described above:

```objc
        CompareArrayBlock compareArrBlock = ^NSComparisonResult(NSNumber *a, NSNumber *b) {
            return [a compare:b];
        };
    
        CompareDictBlock compareDictBlock = ^NSComparisonResult(id k1, NSNumber *v1, id k2, NSNumber *v2) {
            return [v1 compare:v2];
        };
    
        NSNumber *maxArr    = [numberArray max:compareArrBlock];
        NSNumber *maxDict   = [numberDict max:compareDictBlock];
        NSLog(@"Max : Array %@ - Dict %@", maxArr, maxDict);
    
    #pragma mark - min
        NSNumber *minArr    = [numberArray min:compareArrBlock];
        NSNumber *minDict   = [numberDict min:compareDictBlock];
        NSLog(@"Min : Array %@ - Dict %@", minArr, minDict);
```

##sort

Sort is actually just an alias for `[self sortedArrayUsingComparator:block];`

- `- (NSArray *) sort:(NSComparator) block;`

See [NSArray sortedArrayUsingComperator:](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSArray_Class/NSArray.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSArray/sortedArrayUsingComparator:) for reference.

Here's an example:

```objc
    NSComperator compareArrBlock = ^NSComparisonResult(NSNumber *a, NSNumber *b) {
        return [a compare:b];
    };

    NSArray *nrReversed = [numberArray reverse];
    NSArray *sorted     = [nrReversed sort:compareArrBlock];
    NSLog(@"%@ becomes %@ when sorted", nrReversed, sorted);
```

##group

Groups an array by the values returned by the iterator.

- `- (NSDictionary *) group:(MapArrayBlock) block;`

Here's an example that groups an array into an odd numbers section and an even numbers section:

```objc
	NSDictionary *oddEvenArray = [numberArray group:^NSString *(NSNumber *obj) {
        if (([obj intValue] % 2) == 0) return @"even";
        else return @"odd";
    }];
	NSLog(@"Grouped array %@", oddEvenArray);
```

##times

Call times on an `NSNumber` (n) to iterate n times over the given block.

- `- (void) times:(VoidBlock) block;`

Here's a simple example - it prints 'have i told you' once:

```objc
    NSNumber *howMany   = [numberArray first];
    [howMany times:^{
        NSLog(@"have i told you?");
    }];
```

##NSArray additions

###arrayFrom:To:

Creates an array, that contains the range as individual NSNumbers

- `+ (NSArray *) arrayFrom:(NSInteger) from To:(NSInteger) to;`

Example:

```objc
	NSArray *rArr = [NSArray arrayFrom:0 To:3];
    NSLog(@"Array from 0 to 3 %@", rArr);
```

###first

- `- (id) first;`

Just a shortcut for `[array objectAtIndex:0]`;

###reverse

- `- (NSArray *) reverse;`

Returns the reversed array

###arrayUntilIndex and arrayFromIndexOn

These are helper functions. They return the elements of the array they are called on until (excluding) the given index or from the given index on (including).

- `- (NSArray *) arrayUntilIndex:(NSInteger) idx;`
- `- (NSArray *) arrayFromIndexOn:(NSInteger) idx;`

```objc
	NSArray *untilTwo = [numberArray arrayUntilIndex:2];
	NSArray *afterTwo = [numberArray arrayFromIndexOn:2];
	NSLog(@"The array until idx 2 : %@ and thereafter : %@", untilTwo, afterTwo); // 1,2 and 3,4,5
```


PLWeakCompatibility
===================

Do you like ARC but need to support older OSes? Do you contemplate dropping support for Mac OS X 10.6 or iOS 4 just so you can use `__weak`? Good news! Now you can use `__weak` on those older OSes by just dropping a file into your project and adding a couple of compiler flags.

`PLWeakCompatibility` is a set of stubs that implement the Objective-C runtime functions the compiler uses to make `__weak` work. It automatically calls through to the real runtime functions if they're present (i.e. your app is running on iOS5+ or Mac OS X 10.7+) and uses its own implementation if they're not.

To use `PLWeakCompatibility`:

1. Drop `PLWeakCompatibilityStubs.m` into your project.
2. Add these flags to your Other C Flags in your Xcode target settings: `-Xclang -fobjc-runtime-has-weak`.
3. There is no step 3!

Note that, by default, `PLWeakCompatibility` uses `MAZeroingWeakRef` to handle `__weak` *if* `MAZeroingWeakRef` is present. If not, it uses its own, less sophisticated, internal implementation. If you are already using `MAZeroingWeakRef`, then `PLWeakCompatibility` will take advantage of it. If you're not, you don't need it. There is nothing you need to do to enable the use of `MAZeroingWeakRef`, it will simply be used if it's in your project.


Implementation Notes
--------------------

The built-in weak reference implementation is basic but serviceable. It works by swizzling out `-release` and `-dealloc` on target classes directly. This means that every instance of any weakly referenced class takes a performance hit for those operations, even for instances which are not themselves weakly referenced.

This swizzling *should* be benign, but as with all things runtime manipulation, problems may occur. In particular, I do not anticipate weak references to bridged CoreFoundation objects working at all, and there may be conflicts with Key-Value Observing. The good news is that, since the `PLWeakCompatibility` implementation is only active on older OSes, you have stable targets to test against, and can know that future updates won't affect compatibility.


Compatibility Notes
-------------------

`PLWeakCompatibility` *should* be fully compatible with any OS/architecture/compiler combination which supports ARC. Since the calls are generated at compile time, and the stubs simply call through to Apple's implementations when available, it's extremely unlikely that a future OS update will break an app that uses `PLWeakCompatibility`. All of the tricky business happens on OSes which will not receive further updates.

It is possible that a future version of Xcode will include a compiler which does not get along with these stubs. We consider this possibility to be unlikely, but it's possible in theory. If it does happen, you may continue to build using an old compiler for as long as you support iOS 4 or Mac OS 10.6, and we also hope to be able to fix up any incompatibilities in the unlikely event that this occurs.
